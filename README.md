# CPSC 585 Project
## Tasks to complete:
  - EVERYTHING UNDERNEATH

### Kaynen & Brayden & Keaton
- AI
  - Bug fixing (Down below)
  - Tuning parking parameters

  ### MASSIVE ISSUE
      - Turning timeout (finds zero spaces, turns indefinitely)

  ## AI BUGS 
  - AI attempts to go back to the parking spot it was trying to go to last round
    # Solution
      - Reset the AI searching to a new parking spot PER ROUND?
  - Nodes before parking too close
  - Speed on nodes too fast for before parking?
    # Solution
      - Check if node list is less than or equal to 2 (if so lower speed)
  - AI turning gets stuck on node (indefinite circle)
    # Solution
      - Handbrake to fix turning?
