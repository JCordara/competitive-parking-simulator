# CPSC 585 Project
## Tasks to complete:
  - Menu formatting (where buttons/sliders are placed, consistent look for buttons)

### Kaynen & Brayden & Keaton
- AI
  - Park quicker
  - Bug fixing (fighting for the same spot, parking in spots that aren't open)
  - Tuning parking parameters

  ## Issues found with AI
  - Doesn't end in actual parking spot, ends in node before
    # Solution
      - Add parking subset to node file with ID
  - AI should stop when parked, not continue to turn/spin
  - AI attempts to go back to the parking spot it was trying to go to last round
    # Solution
      - Reset the AI searching to a new parking spot
